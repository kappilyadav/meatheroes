            <p class="paragraph pb-2">While some countries use the same SAP to support time management needs of HR and the business, other countries use different systems. Time solutions was optimized from 26 different brands to less than 6 globally preferred approach. It was to have the same vendor for Payroll and Time in a country, wherever possible, and retain the current solutions where there was no business value to change those.</p>
            <p class="paragraph pb-2">With such an approach in mind, a global solution was decided to be implemented and our expert supported establishing the global end-to-end process. The legacy setup included 26 vendors globally and post the RFP (request for proposal) process the task force engaged and finalized a global solution for 60 countries by partnering with ADP to provide a cloud-based solution i.e., ADP eTime (Kronos Workforce Central). The solution supported both HR Time (Core Time Management) and Business Time (Add-on Activity module) for all employees globally.</p>
            <p class="paragraph pb-2">The ADP eTime solution was implemented in a wave approach. Multiple Workstreams were engaged from different regions providing the business requirements, participating in the workshops, and supporting the testing with good support from the vendor and guidance from the Leadership, the first country went live was successfully completed in January 2022. It was followed by a few more countries in April 2022 as part of the 1st wave and the deployments of further waves are to be continued till mid-2023.</p>
